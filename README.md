# Hybrid notice

This branch will never be merged. Since I discovered that - despite everyone on the forums saying it was impossible - it is possible to create a true hybrid drivetrain and manipulate all attached components at once, I have decided to put this in a repo of its own.

For now I will work on it here, mostly for testing purposes. It will require a new gearbox drivetrain controller to properly manipulate all components of the drivetrain, but that is a very extensive process since the gearbox controllers are already extremely long, and now need even more contingency management and edgecase nonsense to deal with having an electric motor attached.

# ETK800 Facelift, collaborative effort with Spons.

This is the repo for the ETK800 facelift.

Currently contains BMW inspired body panels and lights, as well as my intelligent headlights. The car furthermore features adaptive blinkers, a new exhaust and a fun welcome-lights feature. 

Both mods are required to be installed for this one to work.
