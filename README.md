# ETK800 Facelift, collaborative effort with Spons.

This is the repo for the ETK800 facelift.

Currently contains BMW inspired body panels and lights, as well as my intelligent headlights. The car furthermore features adaptive blinkers, a new exhaust and a fun welcome-lights feature. 

Both mods are required to be installed for this one to work.
